Show only 25 records at a time. 
On transitioning from the (500/25) to (500/25)+1 st page a new fetch will be performed. 
On sort only first 500 will be sorted so If sort order is changed then UI/UX should handle such that the new fetch is performed with new 500 records.

Development - Sandbox\ReferencePOC Team ;   Sandbox\Iteration 4 - Designed & Developed

[Shantanu] Recommendation: Rather than using above approach of using two context & databases, develop web api services for the  second database and use that service into first project. 
Later on this is what will be the case when Architecture team will design and develop something meaningful like MDM (Reference Services), consuming that service into your project will be easy.
Entry point for the service will be as agreed upon - It can be from Web API (Business) section of first Project itself.
